Current Plan 11/19/2022:

Chris C will be fixing the database to meet the requirements 
given in the handout.
Nothing should be effected by this change.
Just make sure you have a local version of the project
just to avoid and work being lost.

Once this changed is in place, then we can start working towards checkpoint 2.
This is essentialy when we get our features working
in terms of our PHP and the database.
We can also add any additional features we wish.

So far we have the login and registration completed.
We need to complete the customers side of being able to put items
in a cart, and then complete a transaction.
We can also list previous orders aswell to prove the order worked.

The employee side will be able to add/remove products to the catalog.
Any other ideas for employee side features are always welcome.

Renato is going to be doing some work between the HTML and PHP
of the customers side, like adding a qty selection to the products.
